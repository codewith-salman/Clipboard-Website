The **Clipboard Website** is a polished landing page and UI concept for a clipboard management tool that helps users **capture, organize, and sync copied content** across devices.  
This project focuses on clarity, speed, and usability — presenting key features, use-cases, and visual demonstrations in an easy-to-read layout.

Built as a lightweight front-end concept, the site highlights core product sections such as **features, how it works, pricing (optional), and download or CTA areas**. The clean design and clear visual hierarchy make it ideal for marketing the product or using as a portfolio piece to demonstrate UI and layout skills.

This project is perfect for:
- Product landing pages for productivity tools

- Marketing pages for web / desktop utilities
